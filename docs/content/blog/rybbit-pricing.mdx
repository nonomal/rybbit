# Rybbit vs Heap Pricing - A Clear, Affordable Alternative to Heap Analytics

If you're researching Heap Analytics, you've probably noticed something frustrating: it's nearly impossible to figure out what you'll actually pay.

Heap's "custom pricing" model means endless sales calls, mystery quotes that vary wildly, and bills that can escalate quickly as your usage grows. According to reviews on G2, Heap's paid plans reportedly start around $3,600 per year—and that's just the beginning. As your data volume increases, so do the costs, often unpredictably.

We built Rybbit as the alternative we wished existed: transparent pricing, powerful features, and fair costs that don't punish you for growth.

Rybbit offers transparent, event-based pricing that scales with your business—not against it. In this guide, we'll walk you through everything you need to know about Rybbit pricing, show you how we compare to Heap, and explain why thousands of websites are making the switch.

## Heap Pricing: The Mystery You Can't Budget For

Before we dive into Rybbit's pricing, let's talk about Heap's pricing problem.

### What Heap Gets Wrong

**Mystery Pricing:** Heap doesn't publish their prices. Every potential customer must contact sales, sit through demos, and negotiate. You won't know the real cost until you're deep in the sales process—and even then, it can change as your usage grows.

**High Entry Costs:** While Heap offers a free tier (10,000 sessions with 6 months of data retention), their paid plans reportedly start around $3,600 annually according to G2 reviews. That's $300/month just to get started with basic features.

**Unpredictable Scaling:** Heap's custom pricing means you can't predict what you'll pay as you grow. Your bill depends on sessions, integrations, and features you need—all priced separately and subject to change.

**Limited Free Plan:** Heap's free tier includes only 10,000 sessions per month and 6 months of data retention. You'll quickly outgrow it, forcing an expensive upgrade.

**Complex Setup Despite Automation:** Heap claims automatic event tracking, but users report needing HTML knowledge and developer resources to use it effectively.

### What Heap Gets Right

To be fair, Heap does have strengths:

- **Automatic event capture** - Tracks user interactions without manual event setup
- **Retroactive analysis** - Can analyze events you didn't know to track initially
- **Funnel and retention features** - Decent conversion and engagement tracking
- **Real-time reporting** - See data as it happens

But here's the thing: Rybbit offers these same capabilities (and more) with transparent pricing and a simpler interface.

## What is Rybbit?

Rybbit is a privacy-friendly, open-source web analytics platform designed for teams who value simplicity, performance, and transparency. Think of it as the analytics tool you'd build if you were frustrated with Google Analytics' complexity and uncomfortable with how it handles your users' data.

Unlike traditional analytics platforms that track everything about your visitors and sell that data, Rybbit gives you the insights you need while respecting user privacy. No cookies required, no consent banners needed, and your data stays yours.

**Fair pricing** - No surprise bills as you grow. Event-based pricing that's predictable and transparent.

### Self-Hosting - Completely Free

- Anyone who wants to avoid recurring analytics costs

Check our [self-hosting documentation](/docs/self-hosting) to learn more about deployment options and requirements.

## How Rybbit Pricing Compares to Heap

Let's do an honest, side-by-side comparison:

### Cost Comparison

**Heap:**
- Free tier: 10,000 sessions/month, 6 months retention
- Paid plans: Starting around $3,600/year (reportedly)
- Growth plan: Custom pricing, 12 months retention
- Pro plan: Custom pricing with additional features
- Premier plan: Custom pricing, everything included

**Rybbit:**
- Free tier: 3,000 events/month, 6 months retention
- Standard: Starts at $19/month ($190/year) for 100,000 events, 2 years retention
- Pro: Starts at $39/month ($390/year) for 100,000 events with session replay, 5 years retention
- Enterprise: Custom (but transparent) pricing for unlimited scale

**The difference?** Rybbit's Pro plan with 100K events costs $390/year—less than 11% of Heap's reported starting price—and includes session replay, 5-year retention, and all analytics features.

### Why Rybbit is Better Value Than Heap

**1. Predictable Costs**

With Rybbit, you know exactly what you'll pay. Choose your event tier, see the price, budget accordingly. No sales calls required.

**2. More Features for Less Money**

Rybbit's Standard plan at $19/month includes features that would cost thousands annually with Heap—and our Pro plan adds session replay for just $39/month.

**3. Better Privacy**

Heap uses cookies and tracks aggressively. Rybbit is cookie-free and privacy-first, meaning no annoying consent banners that hurt your conversion rates.

**4. Open Source Transparency**

You can review Rybbit's code, contribute features, or self-host completely free. Heap is a black box.

**5. Simpler Interface**

Heap requires developer knowledge despite automation claims. Rybbit is genuinely simple—anyone on your team can use it effectively.

**6. Data Ownership**

With self-hosting, your data never leaves your infrastructure. Perfect for regulated industries or teams with strict data policies.

## How Rybbit Compares to Other Analytics Platforms

While Heap is our focus, here's how Rybbit stacks up against other tools:

### Rybbit vs Google Analytics (GA4)

**Cost:** Google Analytics is free, but the real cost is your users' privacy and the complexity tax on your team's time.

**Data Ownership:** Google owns your data and uses it to improve their advertising business. With Rybbit, you own your data completely.

**Complexity:** GA4 has a notoriously steep learning curve. Teams spend weeks learning the interface. Rybbit is intuitive from day one.

**Privacy:** Google Analytics requires cookie consent banners in most jurisdictions. Rybbit doesn't use cookies at all.

### Rybbit vs Plausible

**Pricing:** Plausible starts at $19/month for 10,000 pageviews. Rybbit's free tier gives you 3,000 events free, and our paid plans start at $19/month for 100,000 events.

**Features:** Plausible is intentionally simple. Rybbit offers similar simplicity but adds powerful features like session replay, funnels, user journeys, and error tracking.

Read our detailed [Rybbit vs Plausible comparison](/compare/plausible) for more.

### Rybbit vs PostHog

**Pricing:** PostHog's pricing is complex, charging separately for different features. Rybbit keeps it simple with all-inclusive pricing.

Check our [Rybbit vs PostHog comparison](/compare/posthog) for details.

## Making Sense of Events vs Pageviews

Many analytics platforms charge per "pageview" or "session." Rybbit charges per "event." What's the difference, and why does it matter?

**A pageview** is exactly what it sounds like—someone loads a page on your site. Simple.

**An event** can be a pageview, but it can also be anything else you want to track: button clicks, form submissions, video plays, downloads, purchases, sign-ups, or any custom action.

By charging per event instead of per pageview, Rybbit gives you more flexibility. You can track 100,000 pageviews plus 20,000 custom events and stay within your 120,000 event limit. With a pageview-based platform, you'd pay for the pageviews but tracking those custom events would require a different (often expensive) solution.

For most sites, pageviews make up the majority of events. But if you're tracking user behavior deeply (which you should be), event-based pricing makes more sense and often costs less.

## Why Transparent Pricing Matters (Especially After Heap)

If you've been researching Heap, you've experienced the frustration of mystery pricing firsthand. Here's why we do things differently:

**No Mystery Pricing** - Heap makes you contact sales to learn costs. We publish our prices because you deserve to know what things cost upfront. No sales calls required unless you want enterprise features.

**No Hidden Costs** - Heap's custom pricing means features get added to your bill unpredictably. At Rybbit, the price you see includes everything at that tier. Session replay? Included in Pro. Funnels? Included in Standard. No surprises.

**No Surprise Scaling Costs** - Heap customers report bills escalating dramatically as usage grows. Our pricing tiers are published, so you can predict costs as you scale. Growing from 100K to 500K events? You know it'll go from $19 to $49/month on Standard.

**Actually Useful Free Tier** - Heap's free plan locks you into 10K sessions with 6 months retention. Ours gives you 3K events but with more features available when you upgrade—at prices that won't shock you.

**No Sales Pressure** - With Heap, you can't even try the paid features without talking to sales. With Rybbit, sign up and upgrade whenever you're ready. Self-service all the way.

Transparent pricing respects your time and your budget. You can make decisions independently, compare options honestly, and plan for growth without fear of surprise bills or aggressive sales tactics.

**Does the free plan have a time limit?**

No. Use it forever. We believe analytics should be accessible to everyone, including hobbyists and side projects.

**What counts as an event?**

Pageviews and custom events you track. Each time someone loads a page or triggers a custom event you've set up, that's one event.

**What happens if I exceed my event limit?**

We'll notify you as you approach your limit. You can upgrade to a higher tier, or if you're close to month-end, just wait for the reset. We won't shut off your tracking.

**Can I change plans anytime?**

Yes. Upgrade or downgrade whenever you need. Changes take effect immediately.

**Do you offer discounts for nonprofits or educational institutions?**

Yes! [Contact us](https://www.rybbit.com/contact) and we'll work something out.

**Is there a setup fee?**

No. Never.

**Do you offer refunds?**

Yes. If you're not satisfied within the first 30 days, we'll refund your money, no questions asked.

**Can I pay annually?**

Yes, and you'll save two months compared to monthly billing.

**What payment methods do you accept?**

Credit cards, debit cards, and other standard payment methods through our payment processor.

**Is my data really mine?**

Absolutely. With cloud hosting, your data lives in your dedicated database. With self-hosting, it never leaves your infrastructure. We never sell, share, or use your data for any purpose other than providing you with analytics.

## Making the Switch from Heap to Rybbit

If you're currently using Heap or considering it, here's how to transition to Rybbit:

### 1. Start with the Free Tier

Test Rybbit alongside Heap with our free 3,000 events/month. No credit card required. See the difference in interface simplicity and data clarity.

### 2. Add the Tracking Script

Rybbit's installation is simpler than Heap's. Add one script to your site header and you're tracking immediately. See our [script documentation](/docs/script) for details.

### 3. Set Up Your Events

While Heap uses automatic event capture, Rybbit uses a hybrid approach: automatic pageview tracking plus intentional custom event tracking. This gives you cleaner, more meaningful data. Check our [event tracking guide](/docs/track-events).

### 4. Compare the Experience

Run both tools for a week. You'll likely notice:
- Rybbit's interface is more intuitive
- Data loads faster
- You understand your metrics better
- You're not worrying about what it'll cost

### 5. Upgrade When Ready

Once you're convinced (and you will be), upgrade to the Standard or Pro plan that matches your traffic. Unlike Heap's sales process, you can do this instantly—no calls, no negotiations.
